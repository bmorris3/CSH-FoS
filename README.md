The [CHEOPS mission](https://cheops.unibe.ch/) will be launching in December 2019, and will promply begin collecting precision, space-based photometry of the most compelling transiting exoplanets. With Bern and Switzerland playing a leading role in the development and operations of the CHEOPS mission, the Center for Space and Habitability at the University of Bern will host a small workshop in 2020 (dates TBD) with the goal of discussing cutting-edge techniques for precision photometry including data reduction, analysis and interpretation. 

More details will be posted here as they become available.
